<quote>Dear SkyHanni users,

As the sole developer of SkyHanni, I wanted to inform you that I have temporarily stopped working on new features due to complications with kotlin compatibility in newer versions of NotEnoughUpdates. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and I hope to have a resolution as soon as possible.

In the meantime, I am working on a new solution with the same features as SkyHanni to ensure that it is compatible with newer versions of NotEnoughUpdates. I will keep you informed of any updates and hope to have it available soon.

Thank you for your understanding and continued support.

Sincerely,
Lorenz (aka hannibal2)
