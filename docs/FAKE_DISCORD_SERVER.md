# Beware of Fake Discord Impersonating SkyHanni


## What is happening?

We've discovered a fake Discord server pretending to be SkyHanni.
This fake server looks very similar to ours, with more than 15,000 users, with similar channel names and our profile picture.
They even have a user named "hannibal2."

It's crucial to know that this fake server has nothing to do with the real SkyHanni server.

The people behind this fake server want to steal your minecraft account!
They will ask you to verify your identity by clicking on a Microsoft link to access chat channels.

To keep yourself safe, please don't interact with this fake server, and leave it immediately.

## Why dont we do anything about them?

We have successfully reported and taken down the server in the past.
But the server got always recreated shortly after.
Sadly the Discord support team has stopped responding after a while.

## I have got hacked / my account got stolen. What to do?

### I cant log in into my account anymore

You can try to get your account back by contacting microsoft support.
You need to send them a ticket via your email, telling them what happened.
Also provide them with exact information how and when you have bought your minecraft account.
Good luck!

### Someone else logged in into my account, but I can still access the account myself

Disable the multiplayer mode on xbox account settings to prevent others from logging in your account immediately.
Try to log in on hypixel to kick the other user off from hypixel.
Change your password on minecraft.net.
Wait 24 hours and enable multiplayer mode again.

## How to detect the fake server?

> The fake server asks you to verify via entering data.

The real server will never ask you to enter your account name and password.

> The fake server has many channels without any sent message sent or without access to see the messages in the channel

The real server has a lot of channels you can view and everyone of them has a lot of messages that (for some channels) even go back over a year.

> The fake server does not link to anyhting outside itself.

The real server has channels that link to github, to updates, to other ressources etc.

> The fake server does not allow you to write in the chat.

The real server has a bunch of channels you can write in. You can see the chat history in those channels way back.
