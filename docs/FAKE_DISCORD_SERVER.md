**Beware of Fake Discord Impersonating SkyHanni**

We've discovered a fake Discord server pretending to be SkyHanni.
This fake server looks very similar to ours, with more than 15,000 users, with similar channel names and our profile picture.
They even have a user named "hannibal2."

It's crucial to know that this fake server has nothing to do with the real SkyHanni server.

The people behind this fake server want to steal your minecraft account!
They will ask you to verify your identity by clicking on a Microsoft link to access chat channels.

To keep yourself safe, please don't interact with this fake server, and leave it immediately.

The real invite link is https://discord.gg/skyhanni-997079228510117908
