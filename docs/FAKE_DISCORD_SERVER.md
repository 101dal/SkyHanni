**Beware of Fake Discord Impersonating SkyHanni**

We've discovered a fake Discord server pretending to be SkyHanni.
This fake server looks very similar to ours, with more than 15,000 users, with similar channel names and our profile picture.
They even have a user named "hannibal2."

It's crucial to know that this fake server has nothing to do with the real SkyHanni server.

The people behind this fake server want to steal your minecraft account!
They will ask you to verify your identity by clicking on a Microsoft link to access chat channels.

To keep yourself safe, please don't interact with this fake server, and leave it immediately.

The real invite link is https://discord.gg/skyhanni-997079228510117908


# How to detect the fake server?

> The fake server asks you to verify via entering data.

The real server will never ask you to enter your account name or password.

> The fake server has many channels without any sent message sent or without access to see the messages in the channel

The real server has a lot of channels you can view and everyone of them has a lot of messages that (for some channels) even go back over a year.

> The fake server does not link to anyhting outside itself.

The real server has channels that link to github, to updates, to other ressources etc.

> The fake server does not allow you to write in the chat.

The real server has a bunch of channels you can write in. You can see the chat history in those channels way back.
